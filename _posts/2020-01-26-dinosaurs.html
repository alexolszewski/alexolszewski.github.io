<p>Horizontal and Vertical lines are by far the easiest to graph.Also their equations
are easy to write.With a very basic understanding of points and the coordinate
plane, anyone can graph these lines.Remember that every time we talked about
Horizontal lines we looked at the horizon; we looked at the line the sun dives into.
Horizontal lines go indefinitely from left to right.
Vertical lines are the exact opposite of horizontal lines.You don't stand
horizontally; you stand vertically.Vertical lines go indefinitely from top to bottom
or from bottom up. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Horizontal Lines</h2>

<p>Horizontal lines have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>They have Zero Slope.</p>
<p>They are drawn from left to right through the y-axis.</p>
<p>The equation only has one constant to determine where it will be
drawn. Such as (y = 5, y = - 3, y = 17, etc.)</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Vertical Lines</h2>

<p>Vertical lines have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>They have an Undefined Slope.</p>
<p>They are drawn from top to bottom through the x-axis.</p>
<p>The equation only has one constant to determine where it will be
drawn. Such as (x = 1, y = 4, y = -11, etc.)</p>
